=======

pymazon.booksearch is a simple library for searching Amazon.com via Amazon's affiliate APIs.  It focuses only on book searching.  It's a little too OO for my taste, it lacks docs and tests, but it is being used in production on multiple sites, and is actively maintained.  Consider this an early preview release.
